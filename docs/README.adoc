= QCC

This is the `README` for QCC.  There's not much here yet but be sure to read link:Overview.adoc[the overview].

== Building

To build the project, execute `mvn install` in the root.

== Class Library

QCC cannot run without https://github.com/quarkuscc/qcc-class-library[`qcc-class-library`].

After you have built QCC, fetch and install the class libraries as follows:

[source,shell]
-----
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:quarkuscc/qcc-class-library.git
cd qcc-class-library
mvn install
-----

== Running

To run the driver, first build the project and then use https://jbang.dev[`jbang`] to run it:

[source,shell]
-----
jbang --quiet cc.quarkus:qcc-main:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT --boot-module-path /path/to/main.jar:/my/.m2/repository/cc/quarkus/qccrc/qccrt-java.base-11.0.1-SNAPSHOT --output-path /tmp/output the/main/Class
-----

Replace the `java.base` JAR with your locally-built JAR path from <<Class Library>>.
